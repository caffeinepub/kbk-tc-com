  "summary": "The diff implements the overall step-based SPA structure and warm romantic styling, but several requirements are missing or not met exactly: the quiz Yes/No button labels are not exactly \"Yes\"/\"No\", the post-quiz \"Game\" button step is not implemented as specified, the tap feedback is not guaranteed to appear for every registered tap, the site/browser title metadata change is not evidenced, and the required heart icon image asset is not shown as being used (Lucide icons are used instead). Unrequested Internet Identity/auth scaffolding and an empty backend actor were added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Quiz questions must be presented with two buttons labeled exactly \"Yes\" and \"No\".",
      "reason": "The implemented buttons include extra emoji text (\"Yes 💚\" and \"No 💔\"), so the labels are not exactly \"Yes\" and \"No\".",

        "frontend/src/components/YesNoButtons.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "After the quiz, add a \"Game\" button shown after the quiz is completed; clicking it reveals the chibi dino intro dialogue and a start button.",
      "reason": "The app transitions directly from quiz completion to the game intro step without a dedicated post-quiz \"Game\" button, and the game intro uses a \"Let's Play!\" button rather than a \"Game\" button.",

      "requirement": "During the tapping game, on each tap show a floating feedback message (from a pool including the specified strings) and a per-tap cute effect; petals animate during gameplay.",
      "reason": "Tap counting is driven by a document-level `pointerdown` listener, but floating feedback/effects are created only in `handleTap` (pointer events on the tapping area). This means some registered taps may not produce the required visible feedback/effect, so it is not evidenced that \"each tap\" triggers feedback.",
